### TRACKERS

**Privacy & Data Security**

In the wake of the enactment of the California Consumer Privacy Act, a
number of states have introduced copycat measures seeking to expand
consumer privacy rights. Bloomberg Law's new [Comprehensive Consumer
Privacy Legislation
Tracker](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/privacy/document/X3E8DPGS000000 "Comprehensive Consumer Privacy Legislation Tracker")
keeps users abreast of these developments by providing summaries of the
proposals and links to the underlying bills. Attorneys and compliance
professionals may need to revise recommendations and best practices as
they navigate a more complex regulatory landscape in light of these
measures. The tracker is accessible via the [Privacy & Data Security
Practice

### IN FOCUS

**Banking & Finance**

[In Focus: Legislation on Criminal Use of
FinTech](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/bf_home/page/bf_infocus_criminal_fintech "In Focus: Legislation on Criminal Use of FinTech")
focuses on two bills that recently passed in the House of
Representatives with bipartisan support. Both bills direct government
agencies to take a closer look at how financial technology, such as
virtual currency, is being used in the commission of crimes such as
human trafficking or terrorism. The page provides summaries for each
bill, as well as related bills from the previous congress, and important
links. The new In Focus page can be found on the [Banking and Finance
Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/page/bf_home "Banking and Finance Practice Center"),
as well as the [In Focus
Resources](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/infocus_home "In Focus Resources")
homepage. 

[In Focus: NYDFS Cybersecurity
Regulations](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/bf_home/page/bf_nydfs_cyber "In Focus: NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulations")
focuses on New York's cybersecurity regulations, which apply to banks,
insurance companies, and other entities regulated by the New York
Department of Financial Services. These first-in-the-nation regulations
require regulated entities to meet certain cybersecurity standards, to
designate a Chief Information Security Officer, and to have plans in
place to deal with data breaches and other incidents. Regulated entities
must certify compliance with the regulations by February 15, 2019. The
page provides relevant forms, important links, and also highlights the
Privacy & Data Security Practice Center's Practical Guidance on this
topic. The new In Focus page can be found on the [Banking and Finance
Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/page/bf_home "Banking and Finance Practice Center"),
as well as the [In Focus
Resources](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/infocus_home "In Focus Resources")
homepage.

[In Focus: Current Expected Credit Losses
(CECL)](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/bf_home/page/bf_infocus_cecl "In Focus: Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL)")
focuses on the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) new
accounting standard that will require banks to record their expected
losses over the lifetime of a loan, or the current expected credit
losses (CECL), upfront. Most entities will be expected to have adopted
the rule by January 2020. The page tracks the development of the rule,
as well as the current debates surrounding its implementation and how it
may reduce retained earnings for banks. The new In Focus page can be
found on the [Banking and Finance Practice
Center](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/bankfinance/page/bf_home "Banking and Finance Practice Center"),
as well as the [In Focus
Resources](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/page/infocus_home "In Focus Resources")

### IN FOCUS
In Focus: California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

privacy rights and establishes a private right of action for security
breaches and potential statutory damages.  Businesses subject to the
CCPA must comply by Jan. 1, 2020. However, the text of the law contains
a 12-month look-back provision, which requires businesses to respond to
consumer requests for personal information collected or sold within the
past 12 months.
